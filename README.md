# RiivoAutoBuilder

# THIS IS UNFINISHED and i dont recommend using it yet, but it is usuable to an extent

aka don't use it because it's not good enough for fully fledged editing yet

An easy-to-use editor for Riivolution XML files, with some extra perks. 

>ISO builder: will build an ISO or WBFS file out of a Riivolution script, and include all the necessary patches
>Dolphin .ini generator: will create a .ini file composed of memory patches/cheat codes composed in the XML document for use with Dolphin
>ASM2BIN: will create a binary file composed of the ASM data you specify, and add it to your Riivolution document

Aims to speed up the releasing of mods and projects for the Nintendo Wii, and to be able to easily test on the Dolphin emulator
